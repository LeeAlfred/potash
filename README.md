The overarching goals of Potash are to:
Connect Artists and Charities: Create a platform that facilitates and promotes collaborations between artists and charitable organizations.
Facilitate Fundraising: Enable artists to use their creative work to support causes they care about, thereby raising funds for charities.
Promote Artists and Their Work: Provide a platform for artists to showcase their artwork and reach a wider audience.
Increase Awareness for Charities: Help charities gain visibility and connect with new potential donors through the artists and their networks.
Create a Community: Foster a sense of community and collaboration among artists and charities.
Provide a User-Friendly Platform: Develop an accessible and easy-to-use website that effectively connects artists and charities and showcases artwork.
The intended process is artists will have an artist page to list a maximum of 20 items art and allocate a charity that they support and the percentage of the sale they want to allocate to them (10% - 50%).
When a person purchases the item the funds will automatically split into three apportioned to 1) The Artist 2) The Charity 3) Fee
