            <h2>About Potash</h2>
            <p>Potash is a platform born from the belief that art can help save humanity. It's a digital space connecting artists with communities to address needs both big and small, from transforming graffiti to art to raising awareness for important causes.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to empower artists to make a positive difference in the world by providing providing a platform to showcase their work while directly supporting their community through charities they feel strongly about. We envision a global network where artists can work locally and globally, making their art more accessible and supporting meaningful change.</p>
