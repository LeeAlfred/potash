            <img src="img/LeeProfileImage.png" alt="Your Profile Picture">
            <p>Author and Illustrator Lee Sampson, an experienced leader with over 20 years in various industries, uses a people-centric approach and creative vision to make leadership development accessible and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
            <p>Relatable and thought-provoking, I illustrate how to: create a positive team culture, demonstrate empathy, communicate effectively, build trust, coach, and mentor those around you.
            </p>
            <p>I chose penguins as the characters as I wanted to be purposeful about highlighting that leadership is universal, transcending every other label we use to define/divide ourselves. My intention is for everyone to be able to see themselves in the illustration.</p>

            <h2>Supporting Mary Potter Hospice</h2>
            <img src="img/logo-marypotter.svg" alt="Mary Potter Hospice Logo">
            <p>For over 40 years, Mary Potter Hospice has provided specialist free-of-charge palliative care services for the people of Wellington, Porirua and KƒÅpiti.</p>
            <p>They provide equitable, compassionate, free-of-charge hospice care working primarily with patients, families and carers in the place they call home, and at our Inpatient Unit in Newtown, Wellington. </p>
            <p>I chose to support Mary Potter Hospice after experiencing first hand the respect and dignity they provide patients and families in the most challenging of times</p>
